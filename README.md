# Lost again Iam in

```
Time is due
Night has passed, Dreams have to end
Still lost in them, Am I!
```
```
Time is due, Dawn's golden hue is in view
Lost again iam in her face golden hue
```
```
Chirping Sparrows dancing all around 
Long tailed Birds singing long melodies in rounds
Lost again iam in her melodious voice doing the ardous rounds
```
```
Fragrance of grape vine straigthens up my spine
Time is due, be quick to pick the grapes laden by dew
```
```
Pair of butterflies catches my eyes
Dancing they are among the vines, their red hued Wings catch my eyes
Lost again iam in red hued dress of thine, Divine when she be in front of my eyes
```
```
Gentle breeze shifts mind back to eyes 
Amidst the Vines,Here again a Tendril catches my eyes
Lost again iam in Hair Locks that eclipses her eyes
```
```
Oh Divine, Let her read these words of mine !!!
....
.....
```
```
Sudden Thunder stirs calm of my mind, Dark clouds dawn on golden sky
Mild rain drops dawn upon her dark round eyes,The sight moisten my eyes
```
```
With moisten eyes Thus clearer sight
Got an insight of her divine heartâ€™s light
```
```
Dozen thoughts dawn in my mind, Is it joy ?
My minds eyes seek the divine Sun up in Sky
Where are you , Enlighten my mind ?
```
```
Darker clouds thunder louder, Sun escapes my eyes
Lame me tries the lamer words to dry her eyes
```
```
Rain Drops pours heavily now, Thunder trembles her voice
Strange Mist dawns on the vine, Brings strange thoughts to my mind

Was it just my lame lines , Is something else in her life ?
Give words to thy moisten eyes, Lighten thine heart and mine

Amidst the mist, lost in the vines
Stuck as she in 7,8,Nines

In Wait of Sun's Light, Golden cloud afar Lights my Sight
Fills gloom in my weary eyes, Wait Another Dawn for Sun and her Divine eyes

Hopeless Night Engulfs Mind and Skies
Desires of her Dreams closes my eyes

Waiting all night for dawns golden light
Ages have passed without her golden face sight
```
```
Time is due 
Night has passed, Dreams have to end
Still lost in them, Am I!
```
